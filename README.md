# Hi there, I'm Raymond!

### I'm following my passion and embarking on a new career in Cloud and/or Network Administration. I currently hold a TS/SCI clearance and have a BS in üíª Information Systems. For the past 21 years, I have served in the ü™ñ as a Geospatial Intelligence Analyst and ‚úàÔ∏è Maintainer. There are several qualities that I developed during this time that would benefit your organization. My most recent role as a Geospatial Intelligence Manager where I oversaw a 200-person unit leveraging my problem solving, communication, and project management skills. I look forward to hearing back from you and scheduling a follow-up.
